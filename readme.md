## Binary Search

Given a sorted array of `n` integers, the binary search algorithm will determine
whether a target exists in the array and find the index of said target. This is
a "Divide and Conquer" algorithm - a design paradigm that breaks a problem down
into smaller versions of the same problem, and then recursively solves them.
